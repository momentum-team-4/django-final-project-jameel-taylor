<!-- # after a deck is selected from deck_list the cards have to randomly
     # appear here and a score needs to be kept track. Would we use JS for this?
     # Like the memory game? Need to ask Will if JS can use django dictionary like 
     # an array from JS. If so we can use the commented out functions in JS & CSS -->
